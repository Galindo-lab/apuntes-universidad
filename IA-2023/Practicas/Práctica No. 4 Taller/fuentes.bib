                  meaning. This article introduces semantic network
                  systems and their importance in Artificial
                  Intelligence, followed by I. the early background;
                  II. a summary of the basic ideas and issues
                  including link types, frame systems, case relations,
                  link valence, abstraction, inheritance hierarchies
                  and logic extensions; and III. a survey of
                  ‘world-structuring’ systems including ontologies,
                  causal link models, continuous models, relevance,
                  formal dictionaries, semantic primitives and
                  intersecting inference hierarchies. Speed and
                  practical implementation are briefly discussed. The
                  conclusion argues for a synthesis of relational
                  graph theory, graph-grammar theory and order theory
                  based on semantic primitives and multiple
                  intersecting inference hierarchies.}
