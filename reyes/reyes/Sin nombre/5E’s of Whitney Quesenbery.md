Being usable or user friendly sounds somehow abstract. But we need to measure the user friendliness of our products in order to make it more user friendly or usable. When the subject is usability, various metrics like effectiveness, performance, satisfaction etc. can be used.

Whitney Quesenbery sums the usability requirements up in 5 dimensions.

- **Effective:** How completely and accurately the work or experience is completed or goals reached
- **Efficient**: How quickly this work can be completed
- **Engaging**: How well the interface draws the user into the interaction and how pleasant and satisfying it is to use
- **Error Tolerant:** How well the product prevents errors and can help the user recover from mistakes that do occur
- **Easy to Learn:** How well the product supports both the initial orientation and continued learning throughout the complete lifetime of use
